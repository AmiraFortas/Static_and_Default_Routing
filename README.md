 Configuring Static Routing

In this TP, we will configuring static and default routing.

The file include: 

1\ Design the topologies.
2\ Assign the IP address.
3 \Configuring routers  (R1, R2,R3).
4\ Assign the interfaces .
5\ Testing conectivity (destination unreachable ).
6\ THEN,we use the Satic ROUTING which define explicit paths between two routers by command (ip route IP mac address serial or next hope).
7\Verfication on route table (show ip route).
8\Testing conectivetity again (ping successuful).
9\ Doing the above instructions in Topology 2 in addition LAN 3

Topology 01- packet tracer file  .

	/*Topolgy 1:  2 Routers, 4 Pc's , 2 Switches , Cables ( Gigabitethernet,Fast ethernet ,Serial ) , 2 LAN's & 1 WAN 

Topology 02 - packet tracer file  

	/*  Topology 02 : 3 Routers ,6 Pc's , 3switches ,cables Cables ( Gigabitethernet,Fast ethernet ,Serial ), 3 LAN's & 2 WAN.
